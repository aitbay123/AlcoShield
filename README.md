# AlcoShield
 Here's the translated description of the project in English:  ---  **AlcoShield** is a safety system designed to prevent road accidents caused by drunk driving. The project uses modern technologies to not only block the engine start but also automatically send the driver’s location to their family members if the alcohol level exceeds the safe limit.  **How it works:** 1. The system monitors the alcohol level using a sensor (e.g., MQ3). When the alcohol level exceeds a set threshold , the system blocks the engine start, preventing the vehicle from moving. 2. Upon activation, the system automatically retrieves the driver’s geographical coordinates through a GPS module. 3. These coordinates are then sent to the pre-configured family members via **Telegram** bot or **SMS**, so they can pick up the driver and ensure their safety.  **Technical specifications:** - **Alcohol sensor**: MQ3 — a reliable sensor for measuring alcohol concentration in the air. - **GPS module**: for precise location tracking of the driver. - **Microcontroller**: ESP8266 or similar for data processing and notification sending. - **Telegram bot or SMS notifications**: automatic sending of location data to family members through the selected communication channel. - **Communication interface**: a configured **Telegram** bot for sending notifications or using an SMS service for message delivery.  **Key benefits:** - **Safety**: the system blocks the engine start if the alcohol level exceeds the threshold, preventing dangerous driving. - **Fast assistance**: family members receive a message with the driver's exact location, so they can pick them up. - **Technology use**: integration with **Telegram** and **SMS** allows quick and effective notifications to those who can help in case of an emergency.  The AlcoShield project is not only aimed at preventing accidents but also utilizes the latest technologies to care for the safety and well-being of drivers and their families.
